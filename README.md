# IrrationalNumberLib
Implements basic arithmetic operations over irrational numbers\* with a degree of accuracy specified by the user. The degree of accuracy can be arbitrarily high and is limited only by how long you are willing to wait.

\*Really, this program implements operations over *all* real numbers, but rational operations in python are obviously already implemented, and "RealNumberLib" doesn't sound as exciting.
